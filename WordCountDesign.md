## Design Consideations

*What factors do you have to take into consideration? What tradeoffs do you make?
*How do you handle such a huge volume of data?
*What components such a platform would have?
*How would those components interact with each other to solve your problems?
*How would the programmer and user interact with it? What kind of abstractions would you build?
*What kind of SLA guarantees you can provide or not to provide?
*What enterprise concerns that the platform should address for enterprises like KO to embrace it?
*How would you make sure your word counts are in fact accurate?
*Are there any out of the box patterns, utilities or libraries that you will leverage?
